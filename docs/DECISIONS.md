# Decisions Log

Newest entries at the top. Each entry: date, decision, reasoning, and
whether it was an autonomous professional-default call or an
owner-directed one.

## 2026-08-21 — Countertop Materials modeled as Pages, not a CPT

**Decision:** Quartz, Granite, Porcelain, Marble are standard WordPress
Pages under `/countertops/`, not a custom post type.
**Reasoning:** Only four items, each needing rich, mostly unique long-form
content rather than a repeating field schema; a CPT would add taxonomy/
template overhead disproportionate to four hand-written pages. A
`countertop_material` taxonomy on the `project` CPT links portfolio
projects back to these pages instead.
**Type:** Autonomous professional default (explicitly delegated by the
brief: "evaluate whether Countertop Materials should be a structured
content type or standard pages and choose the cleaner architecture").

## 2026-08-21 — ACF fields registered in code; ACF Pro license unverified

**Decision:** Structured fields (Cabinet Collections, Portfolio Projects)
are registered via ACF's PHP field-registration API, not the ACF UI. Ave
gallery/finishes needs are met without ACF Pro-only field types (native
media-library-backed gallery meta, `finish` taxonomy instead of a
repeater), so the build does not depend on an unverified license.
**Reasoning:** A copy of `advanced-custom-fields-pro` was found in the old
site's local plugin directory (see `HANDOFF.md`), which suggests the
owner has purchased ACF Pro at some point, but license validity for *this*
project has not been confirmed, and the brief explicitly says not to
assume license status. Registering fields in code means the project works
identically today on free ACF and can adopt ACF Pro field types later as a
non-breaking enhancement once confirmed.
**Type:** Autonomous professional default, deferring (not blocking on) a
fact only the owner can confirm.

## 2026-08-21 — New local WordPress environment will not reuse the existing "zeus" LocalWP site

**Decision:** The pre-existing `Local Sites\zeus` LocalWP environment on
this machine is a mirror of the **old** production codebase (its theme
folder has its own independent `.git` history, ACF Pro, Yoast, UpdraftPlus,
Contact Form 7, etc. already installed) and will not be used, modified, or
built upon for this project. A separate, clean local WordPress environment
will be created for the rebuild.
**Reasoning:** Explicit brief requirement: "Do not import the old
production site as the foundation. The new WordPress installation must be
clean." Reusing or modifying the existing Local site risks contaminating
what may be the owner's reference copy of the live site.
**Type:** Autonomous professional default, following an explicit brief
rule.

## 2026-08-21 — Git identity scoped to this repository only

**Decision:** Set `user.name`/`user.email` via local (repo-level, not
`--global`) git config for commit authorship, using the owner's known
email for attribution.
**Reasoning:** No global git identity was configured on this machine.
Setting it globally would change git behavior outside this project;
scoping it to the repo avoids that side effect while still allowing
commits.
**Type:** Autonomous professional default.

## 2026-08-21 — Phase 0 project control system initialized

**Decision:** Created local git repo on branch `rebuild/v2`, no remote
connected yet; created `CLAUDE.md`, the `docs/` set, and `.claude/rules/`.
**Reasoning:** Explicit Phase 0 instruction from the owner's brief.
**Type:** Owner-directed (explicit instruction).
